  - text: Modern College of Arts, Science and Commerce,(MCASC) Shivajinagar, Pune- 5 was established in 1970 by Progressive Education Society, Pune, in Maharashtra, founded in 1934. Based on the pedestal ‘ज्ञानमयोभव’ (Dnyanmayo Bhav)meaning ‘Be knowledge Incarnate’ as envisaged by the visionaries who then established the PES, Pune, the entire functioning of the college rests on two key words, ‘Modern’ and ‘Progressive’, in both letter and spirit. It enjoys the status of the first ever college to be instituted by P.E. Society, Pune and has grown from a humble beginning to a glorious destination today in its 46th year of establishment and is aiming to scale greater heights in the fields of education, research, performing arts, sports and social activities. During its initial phase of development, B.A.,B.Com.and B.Sc. degree courses were started in the college. Later during 1994, a major decision to start Post Graduate courses was initiated by the Society and was implemented successfully by the college. The college got NAAC accreditation done in 2003 and then re-accredited with ‘A’ grade in 2010.Modern College, Shivajinagar has several achievements to its credit in the from of awards, schemes, status, Grade. Efforts to inculcate discipline amongst students, establishing systematic mechanism of performance assessment of the students and teachers as well, promoting research, initiating consultancy services and patenting, arranging alumni/ industry-academia meetings, undertaking activities to conserve energy, protect environment, increase allegiance to the society at large to achieving better quality of life (QOL) are some of the hallmark features of the college.In a nut-shell this message could be summed up by taking recourse to the invaluable saying that ‘nothing is more sacred than the education’(cf. Knowledge)‘न हि ज्ञानेन सदृशं पवित्रमिह विद्यते‘is the motto, we all, as a leading education institution, try to live up to at Modern College, Shivajinagar, Pune-5. I would like to thank authorities of Progressive Education Society and each and every individual colleague for his/her valuable contribution in every achievement of the college. I express my deep sense of gratitude to the Chairman, Business Council of Progressive Education Society, Prof. Dr. G. R. Ekbote, for his valuable guidance and continuous encouragement. Prof. P. S. Chirputkar, Dr. A. K. Pande and Prof. Mrs. Jyotsna Ekbote (Chairperson, LMC) and members of LMC have always been a source of support and inspiration. I am also thankful to Prof. Shamkant Deshmukh, Secretary, Progressive Education Society, for his support and encouragement. Thanks are also due to the untiring efforts of the IQAC members, Vice-Principals, Heads of Departments, Members of the Steering Committee and all teachers for their support in our journey towards excellence. The Coordinator and the Assistant Coordinators of IQAC have played a pivotal role in propagating quality initiatives in the college and enhancing further the role of IQAC.
